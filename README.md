# dataanalysis
For File DT and cross validation
For this project I was able to preprocesses the data set so that it could be in a condition were and I can do analytics on it.
For the analysis I used decision tree and 5 fold cross validation to make the initial model more accurate.

For Julia Data Analysis
In this project you are going to develop your own word embedding utilities in Julia using APIs like Word2Vector (https://github.com/JuliaText/Word2Vec.jl) and TextAnalytics (https://github.com/JuliaText/TextAnalysis.jl). You need also to experiment with your developed utilities and demonstrate its usefulness and accuracy. Your utilities need to be useful for in depth applications like:
 Compute similar words: Word embedding is used to suggest similar words to the word being subjected to the prediction model. Along with that it also suggests dissimilar words, as well as most common words.
 Create a group of related words: It is used for semantic grouping which will group things of similar characteristic together and dissimilar far away.
 Feature for text classification: Text is mapped into arrays of vectors which is fed to the model for training as well as prediction. Text-based classifier models cannot be trained on the string, so this will convert the text into machine trainable form. Further its features of building semantic help in text-based classification.
 Document clustering is another application where word embedding is widely used
 Natural language processing: There are many applications where word embedding is useful and wins over feature extraction phases such as parts of speech tagging, sentimental analysis, and syntactic analysis.
With this project you will get experience and knowledge of word embedding and textual analytics in Julia.
